This repository holds bits of code from Math231: The mathematics and statistics of gambling, a course I took while at Stanford.

## Labouchere

My final project for this class was a numerical exploration of the Labouchere betting system, and in particular of the then unsolved question concerning the expectation of the maximum bet size. Check out my [writeup](labouchere/labouchere-system-numerical.pdf) for more info. Also, that problem has since been solved (not by me, of course)! Check out the [solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11729?fbclid=IwAR3VqvyPjCDDx7eyHbKfabsYDgzbG2y_1yKGh2GtrsyGz9MESsQedEwWSAc).
